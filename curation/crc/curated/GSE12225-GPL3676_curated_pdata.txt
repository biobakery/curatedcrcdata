The Limma (linear models for microarray data) package of Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org) was used for importing the data, normalizing the arrays and identifying differentially expressed genes. Control spots and spots with more than 10% saturation, a diameter smaller than 60 m or signal intensity less than 20 counts above background were excluded from the analysis. Data were corrected for local background (method normexp) and normalized within arrays by print-tip loess normalization and between arrays by quantile normalization.///platform_id: GPL3676///contact_name: Esther,,Lips///contact_email: e.lips@nki.nl///contact_phone: +31-20-5122039///contact_fax: +31-20-5122050///contact_department: Experimental Therapy///contact_institute: NKI-AVL///contact_address: Plesmanlaan 121///contact_city: Amsterdam///contact_zip.postal_code: 1066 CX ///contact_country: Netherlands///supplementary_file: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM307nnn/GSM307371/GSM307371.gpr.gz///supplementary_file.1: ///supplementary_file.2: ///data_row_count: 33091"
