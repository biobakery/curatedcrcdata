Primary tumors were obtained at the time of surgical resection, then they were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80C, embedded in optimum cutting temperature freezing media (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL), cryotome sectioned, stained with H&E, and evaluated by a surgical pathologist. Areas with >70% tumor cellularity were identified for RNA isolation. Selected sections of tumor samples were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and total cellular RNA was purified according the instructions of the manufacturer, with additional purification using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and samples were included only if the 18S and 28S bands were discrete and approximately equal.///label_ch1: biotin///label_protocol_ch1: The RNA samples were labeled with IVT labelling kit according to manufacturer's instructions.///taxid_ch1: 9606///hyb_protocol: Standard Affymetrix procedures///scan_protocol: Standard Affymetrix procedures///description: amplified using Nugen WT-Ovation///data_processing: Expression levels were measured in two batches using Affymetrix U133A and U133A Plus 2.0 arrays (Santa Clara, CA). Expression analyses were carried out in the R-software using the package Bioconductor. Expression data in both batches were first subjected for quality assessment by creating the density plot of the log-intensity and RNA degradation plot corresponding to each sample. After preprocessing and quality assessment the two batches were aligned. Probes of the U133A array present in the U133A Plus 2.0 were selected and quantile normalized to mimic the distribution of the U133A array. Five samples had been hybridize in both arrays and served to verify that the correlation of the expression was adequate for the majority of the probes. A total of 331 samples and 419,473 probe sets were subjected to further analysis. Two class comparison of MSI versus MSS tumors were carried out by two-sample t-test to yield a list of differentially expressed probe sets, discriminating between the two biologic states of interest under consideration. We had information on MSI status available from 300 patients and the data set was subsequently reduced to this 300 patients. Then we examined only the expression levels of those genes integrated in the KEGG pathway hsa03440 corresponding to the homologous recombination (a total of 31 genes and their correponding 49 probe sets) using data from a total of 300 CRCs. The issue of multiple testing was addressed by using adjusted P-values after controlling for the overall false discovery rate by Benjamini and Hochberg method (BH-adjusted P-values). We also evaluated the local false discovery rate associated with our probe selection procedure by using the locfdr package in R.///data_processing.1: For all 331 samples, MAS 5.0-calculated signal intensities were normalized using the quantile normalization procedure implemented in robust multiarray analysis and the normalized data were log 2 transformed.  Sample specific median centering and scaling by the standard deviation were additionally applied. Filtering was done to exclude probe sets that were not expressed or probe sets that exhibited low variability across samples. Expression values were required to be above the lower quartile of all expression measurements in at least 25% of samples, and the interquartile range across the samples on  log 2 scale was required to be at least 0.5.///platform_id: GPL570///contact_name: Eduardo,,Vilar///contact_email: evilar@umich.edu///contact_phone: (734) 615-0565///contact_laboratory: Stephen B.
