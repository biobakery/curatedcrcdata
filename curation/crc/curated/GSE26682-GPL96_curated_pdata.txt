After preprocessing and quality assessment the two batches were aligned. Probes of the U133A array present in the U133A Plus 2.0 were selected and quantile normalized to mimic the distribution of the U133A array.

A total of 331 samples and 419,473 probe sets were subjected to further analysis. Two class comparison of MSI versus MSS tumors were carried out by two-sample t-test to yield a list of differentially expressed probe sets, discriminating between the two biologic states of interest under consideration.
