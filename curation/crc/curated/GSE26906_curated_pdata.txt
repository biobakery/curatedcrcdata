As tumor samples and/or RNA samples were provided by 4 different centres, genes were then median-centred within each centre individually.///platform_id: GPL570///contact_name: Sylviane,,Olschwang///contact_email: sylviane.olschwang@inserm.fr///contact_phone: 33(0)491223406///contact_fax: 33(0)491223544///contact_department: Centre de Recherches en Cancrologie de Marseille///contact_institute: Institut Paoli-Calmettes///contact_address: 232 boulevard Sainte-Marguerite///contact_city: Marseille///contact_zip.postal_code: 13009///contact_country: France///supplementary_file: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM662nnn/GSM662720/GSM662720.CEL.gz///data_row_count: 54675"	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
