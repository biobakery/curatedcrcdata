Then, homogenization was carried on as described in the commonly used RNeasy procedure, including an additional treatment step to remove residual DNA contamination with 30 units RNase-free DNase I.///label_ch1: Cy3///label_protocol_ch1: Linear Amplification: One-round of RNA amplification was performed on total RNA as described in [Van Gelder et al., 1990; Eberwine et al., 1992] with some modifications. Amplified RNA products were air dried, resuspended in 10l RNase-free water and then stored at -80C; 1 l of the reaction (1/10) was stored to perform quality assessment (Purity, size, yield). Labeling protocol: Targets were synthesized using 1.0 g amplified RNA, 1 l anchored oligo-(dT) and 2 l random nonamers (GE Healthcare, USA) for priming (total volume 11 l, 10 min, 70C) in presence of 1 l spike RNA from Lucidea Microarray Human Scorecard v1.1 (GE Healthcare, USA). cDNA products were generated using 1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare, USA) and 200 units MMLV RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) at 42C for 2 to 3 hr. After reverse transcription, the RNA was degraded by adding 2 l of 2.5 N NaOH and incubating at 37C for 10 min. The reaction was then neutralized by adding 10 l of 2 M MOPS (free acid) and Cy3- and Cy5-containing targets were purified twice onto QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen, Germany) according the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications. The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA. Thus, certified targets were air-dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 1.5 hr and resuspended in RNase-free water to reach a 10 pmol/l concentration.///label_protocol_ch1.1: ///label_protocol_ch1.2: ///taxid_ch1: 9606///source_name_ch2: REF-Cy5///organism_ch2: Homo sapiens///characteristics_ch2: Universal Reference RNA///characteristics_ch2.1: ///characteristics_ch2.2: ///characteristics_ch2.3: ///characteristics_ch2.4: ///characteristics_ch2.5: ///characteristics_ch2.6: ///biomaterial_provider_ch2: Stratagene, USA///treatment_protocol_ch2: None///growth_protocol_ch2: None///molecule_ch2: total RNA///extract_protocol_ch2: see Provider description///label_ch2: Cy5///label_protocol_ch2: Linear Amplification: One-round of RNA amplification was performed on total RNA as described in [Van Gelder et al., 1990; Eberwine et al., 1992] with some modifications.

Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation. The following selection criteria were applied: all spots having a mean signal (after background subtraction) less than that of the background and below that of the negative controls in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels were systematically excluded; the data were also filtered to exclude spots flagged as missing or corrupted in one array. We next calculated the expression ratios (DATA/REF) in all analyses; the provided VALUE corresponds to the log, base 2 ratios.

The reaction was then neutralized by adding 10 l of 2 M MOPS (free acid) and Cy3- and Cy5-containing targets were purified twice onto QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen, Germany) according the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications. The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA. Thus, certified targets were air-dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 1.5 hr and resuspended in RNase-free water to reach a 10 pmol/l concentration.///label_protocol_ch2.1: ///label_protocol_ch2.2: ///taxid_ch2: 9606///hyb_protocol: A mixture of equimolar aliquots (20 pmol) of each labeled target (DATA and REF) was incubated at 95C for 4 min in the presence of 1.5 g Oligo-A80 (Eurogentec, USA) and 1 g human Cot-I DNA (Invitrogen, USA). Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.

Amplified RNA products were air dried, resuspended in 10l RNase-free water and then stored at -80C; 1 l of the reaction (1/10) was stored to perform quality assessment (Purity, size, yield). Labeling protocol: Targets were synthesized using 1.0 g amplified RNA, 1 l anchored oligo-(dT) and 2 l random nonamers (GE Healthcare, USA) for priming (total volume 11 l, 10 min, 70C) in presence of 1 l spike RNA from Lucidea Microarray Human Scorecard v1.1 (GE Healthcare, USA). cDNA products were generated using 1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare, USA) and 200 units MMLV RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) at 42C for 2 to 3 hr. After reverse transcription, the RNA was degraded by adding 2 l of 2.5 N NaOH and incubating at 37C for 10 min. The reaction was then neutralized by adding 10 l of 2 M MOPS (free acid) and Cy3- and Cy5-containing targets were purified twice onto QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen, Germany) according the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications. The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA.

Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.

The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA. Thus, certified targets were air-dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 1.5 hr and resuspended in RNase-free water to reach a 10 pmol/l concentration.///label_protocol_ch2.1: ///label_protocol_ch2.2: ///taxid_ch2: 9606///hyb_protocol: A mixture of equimolar aliquots (20 pmol) of each labeled target (DATA and REF) was incubated at 95C for 4 min in the presence of 1.5 g Oligo-A80 (Eurogentec, USA) and 1 g human Cot-I DNA (Invitrogen, USA). Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.

Amplified RNA products were air dried, resuspended in 10l RNase-free water and then stored at -80C; 1 l of the reaction (1/10) was stored to perform quality assessment (Purity, size, yield). Labeling protocol: Targets were synthesized using 1.0 g amplified RNA, 1 l anchored oligo-(dT) and 2 l random nonamers (GE Healthcare, USA) for priming (total volume 11 l, 10 min, 70C) in presence of 1 l spike RNA from Lucidea Microarray Human Scorecard v1.1 (GE Healthcare, USA). cDNA products were generated using 1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare, USA) and 200 units MMLV RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) at 42C for 2 to 3 hr. After reverse transcription, the RNA was degraded by adding 2 l of 2.5 N NaOH and incubating at 37C for 10 min. The reaction was then neutralized by adding 10 l of 2 M MOPS (free acid) and Cy3- and Cy5-containing targets were purified twice onto QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen, Germany) according the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications. The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA.

Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.

The Cy-dye targets were controlled during quality assessment (purity, size, yield). Adjusted Cy-dye target yield was calculated to reflect carryover of unlabeled aRNA. Thus, certified targets were air-dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 1.5 hr and resuspended in RNase-free water to reach a 10 pmol/l concentration.///label_protocol_ch2.1: ///label_protocol_ch2.2: ///taxid_ch2: 9606///hyb_protocol: A mixture of equimolar aliquots (20 pmol) of each labeled target (DATA and REF) was incubated at 95C for 4 min in the presence of 1.5 g Oligo-A80 (Eurogentec, USA) and 1 g human Cot-I DNA (Invitrogen, USA). Fragmented labeled cDNA was then placed onto 11K_VJF-ARRAY slides in a 30 l hybridization solution (50% formamide, GE Healthcare, USA) and covered by a coverslip. The slides were subsequently hybridized in a humid hybridization cabinet (GE Healthcare, USA) for 16 hr at 42C. Then the hybridized slides were washed in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C, twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 55C and twice in 0.1x SSC for 1 min at room temperature.///scan_protocol: After washing and drying, the arrays were scanned at 532 nm (PMT 600 V) and 635 nm (PMT 650 V) using a 3rd generation array scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) and independent grayscale images (8 bits, Tiff) were generated for each pair of samples to be compared.///description: Quality Controls of RNA samples: Concentration and purity of the RNA preparation was checked first by UV-spectrophotometry using the Ultrospec3100 pro (GE Healthcare, USA) and 5-mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Quality of each total RNA was measured by microfuidic/capillary electrophoresis using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the results assessed by human inspection and with two-user independent classifiers evaluation as described previously [Imbeaud et al., NAR, 2005]. Only samples that reached the anticipated purity and integrity parameters (RIN >= 6; DegFact <= 13) were introduced within the microarray pipeline process. Quality Controls of IVT transcription: Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) and amplified RNA (aRNA) products were analyzed for purity and concentration by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 5-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare, USA). The absorbance (A) was measured from 200 nm to 350 nm. A235, A260, A280 and A320 were determined and A260:A280 ratios were calculated. Three metrics were considered based on the A260 measurement. First, efficiency of the reverse transcription (ds-cDNA quantity/total RNA quantity) and IVT (aRNA quantity/ds-cDNA quantity) reaction efficiencies were computed. The yield of amplification was quantified (aRNA quantity/mRNA quantity), with the assumption that total RNA contains 2% of mRNA. Finally, an aliquot (1 l) of the IVT reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol. An mRNA nano assay was run on the chip, and the size of the aRNA was compared with the molecular weight markers. On one hand, ds-cDNA product with unsatisfactory reverse transcription reaction efficiency (RT  0.4) and purity (A260:A280 ratios  1.6) were removed from the IVT reaction pipeline. On the other hand, aRNA products with unsatisfactory yield of amplification (amplification < 1,000) and integrity (mean size < 1,000 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. Only samples that reached the expected purity and integrity parameters described above were introduced within the microarray labeling and hybridization pipelines. Quality Controls of Cy-Dye target labeling: Purity and concentration of each target was checked by UV spectrophotometry, using the Ultrospec3100 pro and 70-mm cuvettes (GE Healthcare). Based on the absorbance measured at 256 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm and considering extinction factor for Cy3- and Cy5-dye respectively of 0.15 and 0.25, the yield of cDNA synthesis and dye incorporation rate were computed. An aliquot (1 l) of the purified labeling reaction was loaded onto RNA 6000 Nano Labchip using a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The chip was prepared according to the manufacturers protocol and a mRNA nano assay was run on the chip. The shape and sizes of the Cy-dye targets were compared with the molecular weight markers. Targets with unsatisfactory yield of incorporation (dye incorporation rate < 10; A256:A550 or 650 < 2) and integrity (size < 200 nucleotides) were removed from subsequent analyses. The shape of the Cy-dye probes should present a smeared profile with no clearly identified additional peaks.///description.1: NA///description.2: ///description.3: ///description.4: NA///description.5: ///data_processing: Foreground (raw) data - ARMDens - were local background-subtracted (corners between spots - median value) and normalized using a Lowess (locally weighted linear regression) transformation.
