After laser-capture microdissection frozen tissue specimens were serially cut into 68-m-thick sections which were mounted on a sterile 2.5 mm membrane. Slides were fixed in 70% ethanol. The sections were briefly stained with haematoxylin and eosin, dehydrated in ethanol and dried for 1015 min using an exsiccator. The membrane was turned around and fixed with adhesive tape on the other sterile slide. First slides served as a template on which the areas of tumor or normal epithelium were marked. On the consecutive section, these areas were microdissected using a laser microdissection system (SL, Jena, Germany and P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG Bernried, Germany) and capture transfer films (Arcturus GmbH, Moerfelden-Walldorf, Germany). For molecular analysis, up to 100,000 cells or approximately 3060 mm2 of tissue section areas were pooled and collected in ice-cooled tubes containing 100 ml of 98% guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) buffer and 2% beta-mercaptoethanol.///extract_protocol_ch1.1: PolyA mRNA from the microdissected specimens was prepared using the PolyA-tract 1000 kit (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers recommendations.///label_ch1: biotin///label_protocol_ch1: For each sample, the cDNA synthesis and repetitive in vitro transcription were performed three times.

The second strand cDNA synthesis was generated by internal priming. In vitro transcription was performed using the Megascript kit (Ambion, Huntington, UK) as recommended by Ambion. From the generated cRNA, a new first strand synthesis was initiated using 0.025 mM of a random hexamer as primer. After completion, the second strand synthesis was performed using the Affymetrix T7-oligo-dT promoter-primer combination.

After laser-capture microdissection frozen tissue specimens were serially cut into 68-m-thick sections which were mounted on a sterile 2.5 mm membrane. Slides were fixed in 70% ethanol. The sections were briefly stained with haematoxylin and eosin, dehydrated in ethanol and dried for 1015 min using an exsiccator. The membrane was turned around and fixed with adhesive tape on the other sterile slide. First slides served as a template on which the areas of tumor or normal epithelium were marked. On the consecutive section, these areas were microdissected using a laser microdissection system (SL, Jena, Germany and P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies AG Bernried, Germany) and capture transfer films (Arcturus GmbH, Moerfelden-Walldorf, Germany). For molecular analysis, up to 100,000 cells or approximately 3060 mm2 of tissue section areas were pooled and collected in ice-cooled tubes containing 100 ml of 98% guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) buffer and 2% beta-mercaptoethanol.///extract_protocol_ch1.1: PolyA mRNA from the microdissected specimens was prepared using the PolyA-tract 1000 kit (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers recommendations.///label_ch1: biotin///label_protocol_ch1: For each sample, the cDNA synthesis and repetitive in vitro transcription were performed three times. The total amount of prepared mRNA from each sample was used. First strand cDNA synthesis was initiated using the Affymetrix T7-oligo-dT promoter-primer combination at 0.1 mM. The second strand cDNA synthesis was generated by internal priming. In vitro transcription was performed using the Megascript kit (Ambion, Huntington, UK) as recommended by Ambion. From the generated cRNA, a new first strand synthesis was initiated using 0.025 mM of a random hexamer as primer. After completion, the second strand synthesis was performed using the Affymetrix T7-oligo-dT promoter-primer combination.
